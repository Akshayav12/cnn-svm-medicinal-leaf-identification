# cnn-svm-medicinal-leaf-identification
This repository implements a hybrid CNN-SVM model for medicinal leaf identification, combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
# Key Features
✅ Pretrained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for deep feature extraction.  
✅ SVM classifier to enhance classification performance.  
✅ Medicinal leaf dataset for training and validation.  
✅ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
# How It Works
CNN extracts deep features from medicinal leaf images.  
Features are flattened and passed to an SVM classifier.  
SVM classifies the leaf species based on extracted feature
# Dataset
The dataset contain segmented medicinal leaf dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshranjansaroj/segmented-medicinal-leaf-images
